# Firmware for 23cm NBFM transceiver

Currently unaltered firmware from [Werner Mause (JN48OL)](https://github.com/wemaus/23cm-NBFM-Trx).

The directory structure has been altered to match [platformio](https://piolabs.com/) standards.

The code is due to be modified to accomodate revised schematic.

In the mean time, the following works.

## Build the code

 * Normal build: `pio run`
 * Verbose build: `pio run -v`

## Lint the code

 * `pio check`
