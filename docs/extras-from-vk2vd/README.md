# Extra resources from VK2VD

VK2VD was kind enough to send me some further information.

First, he provided some English translations of stages 2 and 3 of [Wemaus' build site](http://www.mdtweb.de/index.php/projekte/nachrichtentechnik/nachrichtengeraete/23-cm-fm-transceiver/). I have not included those here in the repository because you can easily generate your own translations using [translate.google.com](https://translate.google.com) or similar services and being docx files with images they were relatively large.

Second, he provided a higher resolution version of his revised schematic which incorporates his suggested fixes to thermal issues observed with the previous schematic.
